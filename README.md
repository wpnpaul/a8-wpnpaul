I used the terminal to make this git and couldn't commit since my mac is 
tied to my personal git account but the eclipse git stuff automatically handles the
different git account for my school account.

I couldn't figure out how to git init using eclipse so I did it through terminal. Sorry for the
confusion and I hope the commit from my personal account isn't an issue.
